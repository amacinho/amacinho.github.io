The idea is to create an interactive tool that allows us to explore what topics expectant parents discuss over the course of a pregnancy. I wanted to see how the emotions, concerns, information needs, and experiences of expecting parents evolve from conception to birth and into the early months of parenthood. The underlying data comes from public pregnancy discussion forums where posts are organized by gestational week.\nSo what do these discussions actually look like across pregnancy? Let us start with an example.\nThe Tool in Action Here is how the volume of discussions where people express anxiety over the course of pregnancy:\n(click here to see the live version)\nWe immediately see two peaks of anxiety-related discussions: one around weeks 5-8, which corresponds to the highest risk period for miscarriage, and another right before the due date, dropping sharply after birth.\nHow It Works Instead of searching over all posts – which would be prohibitively time consuming on a browser and would increase the size of the data to upload to the user’s device – the tool searches over a much smaller set of clusters first to identify semantically relevant topics. In the tool we have over 3000 clusters and they tend to be quite coherent, and usually specific to certain stages of pregnancy. Below, we see a few example clusters with their LLM-generated labels and post summaries:\nFor a given broad query, such as “anxiety”, the tool retrieves semantically close clusters based on cosine similarity between the query embedding and cluster embeddings (computed as the centroid of post embeddings within each cluster). The tool then aggregates post counts within the retrieved clusters over gestational weeks to produce the bar plot we saw above showing how the volume of “anxiety” discussions evolve over time.\nRefined Search However, just seeing the evolution of a broad topic is not enough. I want to see how different sentiments or contexts around “anxiety” change over time. For this, the tool allows users to run a refined search over LLM-generated, stylistic summaries of posts within the retrieved clusters only. For example, users can provide refinement queries such as “Is OP worried about miscarriage?” and get an estimate of how many posts within the “anxiety” clusters match to the refined query:\n(Link to this search)\n(Link to this search)\nDue to the limitations of the cross-encoder models, we see there are some early-pregnancy posts that are incorrectly matched to the refined query (e.g., “Is OP worried about c-section?”). But, the tool allows the user to select/deselect specific clusters and get more precise estimates while building confidence (or, if the model cannot capture the nuance, not being misled).\nDesign Principles Now that we have seen what the tool does, here are the three core principles that shaped its design:\nPrivacy-first: Even though the data is based on public pregnancy forums, I wanted to ensure that personally identifiable information is neither exposed nor stored in the tool once preprocessing is complete.\nHonest and Transparent: The tool involves embeddings, dimensionality reduction, clustering, cross-encoder models, and other statistical estimation – techniques that add extra layers of inferential processing between the raw data and the final results which are prone to errors. I wanted to build a tool that did not hide its mistakes, but be transparent about its limitations and rather made them clear to the user.\nCheap if not Free: I don’t want to pay for or maintain a server for this. That leaves out solutions that required a backend, limiting computation locally and offline.\nIn practice, here’s how these principles manifest in the tool:\nBy using LLM-generated summaries of sanitized post texts which were themselves generated via a privacy-preserving preprocessing pipeline, I can ensure the data sent to users’ browsers does not contain any personally identifiable information.\nBy providing uncertainty estimates and showing example post summaries, and allowing users to select/deselect specific clusters from the interface, the tool maintains transparency about its limitations and allows users to make informed judgments about the results. If the reranker model is not capturing the nuance of a user’s refined query well, the user can see this from the example summaries and adjust their query or cluster selection accordingly.\nThis two-stage retrieval and refinement approach allows the tool to run efficiently in the browser without a backend server. For a tool that allows to explore a 300K+ post dataset with complex semantic queries, the system only needs to send less than 40MB of precomputed data (embeddings, cluster labels, post summaries, gestational week metadata) to the user’s browser once. Subsequently a broad query and a refinement query usually costs fractions of a cent in OpenRouter embedding and Novita AI cross-encoder API calls.\nConclusion Fourteen years after first wondering what other expecting parents worry about, I finally have a tool to explore that question. Whether you’re curious about when certain concerns peak, or want to see how common your experience is, I hope this tool offers some insight. I want to finish with one insight I found particularly interesting.\nAs expected, discussions about pregnancy cravings peak at the end of the first trimester (around week 12) and then taper off steadily afterwards.\nHowever, cravings about unusual non-food items (gasoline smell, dirt, chalk?!) peak much later, toward the end of pregnancy (around week 35). I haven’t seen any specific research on the timing of unusual cravings, but if the pattern I observe here is real, it suggests that different mechanisms may be at play for food vs. non-food cravings during pregnancy.\nTechnical Details With these principles in mind, I had to work around several technical constraints. These limitations led me to precompute as much as possible and serve the tool as a static web app that carried out most of the remaining computation to the user’s browser.\nI reached a solution that used precomputed embeddings to create semantically homogeneous clusters of posts and used these clusters both as a way to summarize the data and as a way to carry out a high-recall retrieval layer for broad semantic queries (such as “husband” or “morning sickness” or “anxiety”). Anthropic’s privacy-preserving AI query exploration tool Clio solves a similar problem, where they auto-generate facetted summaries of users’ queries, cluster them and only make hierarchical clusters available to the explorer. In my use case, I did not want to predefine facets, but rather allow free-form semantic search over the entire pregnancy timeline dataset as an additional challenge.\nPreprocessing Pipeline Step Tool Purpose PII Removal Microsoft Presidio First pass to remove names, locations, dates, and other sensitive information from the text Summarization gemma-3n-e4b-it Generate privacy-preserving post summaries that distill the essence while removing idiosyncratic details Embedding Qwen3-embedding-8b Convert post text into high-dimensional vectors that capture semantic meaning for similarity searches Dimensionality Reduction UMAP Project high-dimensional embeddings into 10D space for efficient clustering Clustering HDBSCAN Group similar posts together based on their embeddings to identify common themes Cluster Labeling gemma-3n-e4b-it Generate human-readable summaries for each cluster Raw Text ↓ Presidio PII Removal → Sanitized Text ↓ Gemma Summarization + KeyBERT Phrases → Privacy-Safe Summaries and key phrases ↓ Qwen3 Embeddings → 1024-dim Vectors ↓ UMAP Projection → 10D Vectors ↓ HDBSCAN Clustering → 3K+ Topic Clusters ↓ Gemma Labeling → Cluster Names \u0026 Descriptions Once the pipeline completes, raw text is discarded. The final dataset contains only sanitized summaries, embeddings, cluster labels, and gestational week metadata for each post.\nExample: Privacy-Preserving Summarization Here’s an artificial example to illustrate how the summarization process works:\nRaw post: “I hate my MIL’s dog: Hi everyone, I’m 25 weeks pregnant. Yesterday my mother-in-law Susan came over to help while my partner Jake was out. While I was trying to rest, her dog knocked over a few things in the living room, and I completely lost it and started crying. It wasn’t really about the mess—it just felt like too much at once. Has anyone else had an emotional reaction to something trivial during pregnancy?”\nAfter Presidio PII removal: “I hate my MIL’s dog: Hi everyone, I’m 25 weeks pregnant. Yesterday my mother-in-law [NAME] came over to help while my partner [NAME] was out. While I was trying to rest, her dog knocked over household items, and I became very upset. It wasn’t really about the incident—it just felt like too much at once. Has anyone else had an emotional reaction to something trivial during pregnancy?”\nFinal privacy-preserving summary (generated by gemma-3n-e4b-it):\n“OP feels upset by MIL’s dog” “OP feels overwhelmed by events” “OP experiences emotional reaction during pregnancy” This is the only information stored and sent to the user’s browser. Total cost was 0.0000439 cents, which amounts to less than 20 cents for 400K posts.\nPipeline Details Text Sanitation: To ensure privacy, the first step of the pipeline uses Microsoft Presidio to remove personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, locations, and dates from the raw post texts. Presidio uses Spacy NER models to identify PII entities and replaces them with generic placeholders. I had to fine-tune Presidio’s configuration to minimize both false positives (over-redaction) of acronyms and forum-specific terms.\nEmbedding and Clustering: Post texts are represented using Qwen3-embedding-8b model via OpenRouter API. I truncated the embeddings to 1024 dimensions. Applied UMAP to reduce dimensionality to 10D for efficient clustering. Used HDBSCAN to cluster posts based on their embeddings.\nPost Phrase Extraction: Using KeyBERT, I extracted key phrases from each post to aid in interpretability and search. I filtered out phrases that were produced by fewer than 10 different authors to provide an additional layer of privacy and reduce noise.\nCluster Labeling: First, I treated each cluster as a single document by concatenating the posts and created c-TF-IDF based phrases to capture important themes. Then, I sampled representative posts from each cluster and together I sent sample posts and the top-scoring c-TF-IDF phrases to gemma-3n-e4b-it model and generated a short label and description for the cluster.\nArchitecture The webapp serves static files on Cloudflare Pages with API calls proxied through a Cloudflare Worker (to protect API keys for OpenRouter embeddings and Novita AI reranking). In case of API errors, the app falls back to simple keyword matching over cluster titles and summaries.\nUser Browser | +-- Static Files (Cloudflare Pages) | \\-- pregnancy.herdagdelen.com | \\-- API Calls +-- /api/embed -\u003e OpenRouter (embeddings) \\-- /api/rerank -\u003e Novita AI (reranking) | Cloudflare Worker (protects my API keys) Precomputation of 300K+ posts takes several hours and costs around $5 in API usage fees.\n","wordCount":"1763","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2026-01-06T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2026-01-06T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Amaç Herdağdelen"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"//www.herdagdelen.com/notes/pregnancy-timeline-trends/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"//www.herdagdelen.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.2.1/css/all.min.css integrity="sha512-MV7K8+y+gLIBoVD59lQIYicR65iaqukzvf/nwasF0nqhPay5w/9lJmVM2hMDcnK1OnMGCdVK+iQrJ7lzPJQd1w==" crossorigin=anonymous referrerpolicy=no-referrer></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">

In my use case, I did not want to predefine facets, but rather allow free-form semantic search over the entire pregnancy timeline dataset as an additional challenge.</p><h3 id=preprocessing-pipeline>Preprocessing Pipeline<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#preprocessing-pipeline>#</a></h3><table><thead><tr><th>Step</th><th>Tool</th><th>Purpose</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>PII Removal</strong></td><td>Microsoft Presidio</td><td>First pass to remove names, locations, dates, and other sensitive information from the text</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Summarization</strong></td><td>gemma-3n-e4b-it</td><td>Generate privacy-preserving post summaries that distill the essence while removing idiosyncratic details</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Embedding</strong></td><td>Qwen3-embedding-8b</td><td>Convert post text into high-dimensional vectors that capture semantic meaning for similarity searches</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Dimensionality Reduction</strong></td><td>UMAP</td><td>Project high-dimensional embeddings into 10D space for efficient clustering</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Clustering</strong></td><td>HDBSCAN</td><td>Group similar posts together based on their embeddings to identify common themes</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Cluster Labeling</strong></td><td>gemma-3n-e4b-it</td><td>Generate human-readable summaries for each cluster</td></tr></tbody></table><pre tabindex=0><code>Raw Text

Yesterday my mother-in-law Susan came over to help while my partner Jake was out. While I was trying to rest, her dog knocked over a few things in the living room, and I completely lost it and started crying. It wasn&rsquo;t really about the mess—it just felt like too much at once. Has anyone else had an emotional reaction to something trivial during pregnancy?&rdquo;</p><p><strong>After Presidio PII removal:</strong> &ldquo;I hate my MIL&rsquo;s dog: Hi everyone, I&rsquo;m 25 weeks pregnant. Yesterday my mother-in-law [NAME] came over to help while my partner [NAME] was out. While I was trying to rest, her dog knocked over household items, and I became very upset. It wasn&rsquo;t really about the incident—it just felt like too much at once. Has anyone else had an emotional reaction to something trivial during pregnancy?&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Final privacy-preserving summary (generated by gemma-3n-e4b-it):</strong></p><ul><li>&ldquo;OP feels upset by MIL&rsquo;s dog&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;OP feels overwhelmed by events&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;OP experiences emotional reaction during pregnancy&rdquo;</li></ul><p>This is the only information stored and sent to the user&rsquo;s browser. Total cost was 0.0000439 cents, which amounts to less than 20 cents for 400K posts.</p><h3 id=pipeline-details>Pipeline Details<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#pipeline-details>#</a></h3><p><strong>Text Sanitation:</strong> To ensure privacy, the first step of the pipeline uses Microsoft Presidio to remove personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, locations, and dates from the raw post texts. Presidio uses Spacy NER models to identify PII entities and replaces them with generic placeholders. I had to fine-tune Presidio&rsquo;s configuration to minimize both false positives (over-redaction) of acronyms and forum-specific terms.</p><p><strong>Embedding and Clustering:</strong> Post texts are represented using Qwen3-embedding-8b model via OpenRouter API. I truncated the embeddings to 1024 dimensions. Applied UMAP to reduce dimensionality to 10D for efficient clustering. Used HDBSCAN to cluster posts based on their embeddings.</p><p><strong>Post Phrase Extraction:</strong> Using KeyBERT, I extracted key phrases from each post to aid in interpretability and search. I filtered out phrases that were produced by fewer than 10 different authors to provide an additional layer of privacy and reduce noise.</p><p><strong>Cluster Labeling:</strong> First, I treated each cluster as a single document by concatenating the posts and created c-TF-IDF based phrases to capture important themes. Then, I sampled representative posts from each cluster and together I sent sample posts and the top-scoring c-TF-IDF phrases to gemma-3n-e4b-it model and generated a short label and description for the cluster.</p><h3 id=architecture>Architecture<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#architecture>#</a></h3><p>The webapp serves static files on Cloudflare Pages with API calls proxied through a Cloudflare Worker (to protect API keys for OpenRouter embeddings and Novita AI reranking).
