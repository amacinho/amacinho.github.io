This matters for applications like brainstorming and creative writing where we want to sample a range of possibilities.\nIn this note, I share results from a kitchen-table experiment: I prompted Claude models with different zodiac signs and Myers-Briggs personality types to see if persona prompts could increase output diversity. My hypothesis is that these persona types are:\nSufficiently distinct to nudge the model into different response modes Familiar enough from training data to produce consistent behavior Broad enough in traits to influence response style To be clear: I’m not assuming astrology or MBTI have any scientific validity, or that the model “believes” in them. I’m just using these well-known archetypes to induce diversity.\nClaude models didn’t seem to mind role-playing as a Sagittarius or INFP. If they had refused, that would have been an interesting data point in itself!\nFor evaluation, I used NoveltyBench (Zhang et al., 2025). NoveltyBench measures diversity as the number of semantically distinct responses out of k samples. Utility combines novelty and quality: a response only counts if it’s both high-quality (scored by a reward model) and meaningfully different from previous responses.\nI tested on the NoveltyBench curated set (100 prompts), comparing MBTI and Zodiac prompting against two baselines: resampling (same prompt 10 times) and paraphrasing (10 rewrites of each prompt). I ran this across Claude Haiku 4.5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and Claude Opus 4.5 with temperature set to 1.\nFor persona prompts, I prepended instructions like “You have a Sagittarius personality…” with a short trait description. I used standard MBTI descriptions and asked ChatGPT for consensus zodiac trait descriptions.\nPrompting Technique Example Prompt(s) Example Responses Paraphrase • \"Select any number from 1 to 100, then share your choice with me.\"\n• \"Think of a number between 1 and 100, and then tell me which one it is.\" 8/10 → 42\n2/10 → 47 Zodiac • \"You have a Libra personality. You are diplomatic, charming, and balanced. Pick a number between 1 and 100.\"\n• \"You have a Leo personality. You are confident, expressive, and warm-hearted. Pick a number between 1 and 100.\" Libra → 50\nGemini → 37\nLeo/Sagittarius → 77\nCapricorn → 73\nScorpio → 13\nCancer → 42\nVirgo/Taurus → 47\nPisces → 33 Here’s another example with the prompt “Pick a random animal”:\nParaphrase (10 samples, 5 distinct animals): Elephant (x6) Octopus, Lion, Bottlenose dolphin, Giraffe\nZodiac (10 samples, 9 distinct animals): Elephant (Taurus), Swan (Libra), Octopus (Aquarius, Virgo), Giraffe (Sagittarius), Cheetah (Aries), Crab (Cancer), Lion (Leo), Chameleon (Gemini), Mountain goat (Capricorn)\nA small note: Using the same persona repeatedly doesn’t help – the model just collapses on a different mode. The diversity gains come from varying the persona across responses.\nResults Curated NoveltyBench results on 100 prompts. Error bars are 95% CIs from 1000 bootstrap samples.\nI also ran Zodiac vs. resampling on the 1000-prompt “wild” set. Budget constraints limited this to Claude Sonnet 4 only.\nOpen Questions Some things I didn’t have time or budget to test:\nDoes this generalize across tasks? Are there meaningful coding style differences between a Sagittarius and a Capricorn agent?\nAre some personas more effective? Would a Pisces – supposedly more creative – produce more diverse outputs than a Taurus?\nDo LLMs prefer certain signs? There’s evidence that people with odd-numbered signs (Aries, Gemini, Leo, etc.) are more likely to believe in astrology, possibly because those signs have more positive trait descriptions (Hamilton, 2001). I tried to replicate this with persona prompting but failed. Though I did get this gem from a Virgo-prompted model:\n“As a Virgo, my analytical nature compels me to seek empirical evidence rather than celestial correlations.”\nReferences\nHamilton, Margaret. “Who believes in astrology?: Effect of favorableness of astrologically derived personality descriptions on acceptance of astrology.” Personality and Individual Differences 31, no. 6 (2001): 895-902.\nZhang, Yiming, Harshita Diddee, Susan Holm, Hanchen Liu, Xinyue Liu, Vinay Samuel, Barry Wang, and Daphne Ippolito. “NoveltyBench: Evaluating Language Models for Humanlike Diversity.” arXiv preprint arXiv:2504.05228 (2025).\n","wordCount":"689","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-12-05T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-12-05T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Amaç Herdağdelen"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"//www.herdagdelen.com/notes/persona-prompts-diversity/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"//www.herdagdelen.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.2.1/css/all.min.css integrity="sha512-MV7K8+y+gLIBoVD59lQIYicR65iaqukzvf/nwasF0nqhPay5w/9lJmVM2hMDcnK1OnMGCdVK+iQrJ7lzPJQd1w==" crossorigin=anonymous referrerpolicy=no-referrer></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
